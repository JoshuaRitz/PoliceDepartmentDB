# PoliceDepartmentDB
This project was an exercise in creating a relational database model for the mini-world of a police department.
The world we live in demands access to and organization of vast amounts of data. As I have a keen interest in law enforcement,
the mini-world I have chosen to model a relational database for is a police department. The chosen design is primed for 
expansion and modification, and could be easily updated to serve the needs of various styles of police departments.
